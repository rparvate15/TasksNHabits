Hello! My name is Rudra, and I created this app to add a little simple Habit tracking functionality to my life, but to (more importantly) learn about Swift coding and app coding. This was a very simple project I coded in spare time, during multiple classes and a long internship. It's super simple and is more of a stepping stone for me onto bigger and more complex app ideas and implementations. Thanks for reading!
